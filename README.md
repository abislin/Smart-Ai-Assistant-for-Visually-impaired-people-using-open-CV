Smart AI Assistant for Visually Impaired People using OpenCV

📌 Project Overview

The Smart AI Assistant is designed to assist visually impaired individuals by integrating computer vision, voice recognition, and AI-powered assistance to provide real-time support. The assistant can perform object detection, read out text, provide navigation assistance, and respond to voice commands.

🚀 Features

🎤 Voice Recognition: Users can interact with the assistant using speech commands.

🗣️ Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts text-based responses into speech output.

📷 Object Detection: Identifies and describes objects in real time using OpenCV.

📌 Wayfinding Assistance: Provides navigation help using GPS and map APIs.

🛤️ Public Transport Guidance: Assists in finding nearby buses, trains, or subway routes.

🌦️ Weather Updates: Fetches real-time weather information.

🖥️ GUI Interface: Intuitive interface built with Tkinter for user interaction.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Computer Vision: OpenCV

Speech Recognition: Google Speech API

Text-to-Speech: pyttsx3

Automation: PyAutoGUI

Navigation & Maps: Google Maps API

GUI Framework: Tkinter

Machine Learning (if used): TensorFlow/PyTorch (for object detection)
